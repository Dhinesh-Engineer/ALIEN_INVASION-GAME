## Pygame Installation
  Install pygame in Windows
        Before installing Pygame, Python should be installed in the system, and it is good to have 3.6.1 or above version because it is much friendlier to beginners, and      additionally runs faster.

## Installing through pip: 
  The good way to install Pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). The command is the following:
   
    py -m pip install -U pygame --user  

## To check whether the pygame is properly installed or not, in the IDLE interpreter, type the following command and press Enter:
     import pygame  


If the command runs successfully without throwing any errors, it means we have successfully installed Pygame and found the correct version of IDLE to use for pygame programming.
